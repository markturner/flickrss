Flickr Photoset RSS feed generator
----------------------------------

This is a lightweight ruby app, using sinatra, that returns an rss feed of a specified user's Flickr photosets.

This is functionality that, puzzlingly, has never been provided by Flickr.

Feel free to steal it and do with it what you wish.
