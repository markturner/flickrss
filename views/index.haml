  %p#error Couldn't recognise your Flickr ID! Are you sure it's correct?

%p This website will generate an RSS feed of your Flickr Photosets, something which, puzzlingly, has never been provided by Flickr themselves.
%p Enter your Flickr ID into the box below and hit 'generate' to produce your RSS feed:
%form{:method => "get", :action => "/link"}
  %input{:type => "text", :name => "user"}
  %br
  %input{:type => "submit", :value => "Generate", :id => "submit"}
%p Note that your Flickr ID is not your username, it is a string of numbers and letters that looks like this: 98551956@N00
